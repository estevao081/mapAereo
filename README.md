## 🧭 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                          |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/products`        | Get all products                     |
| GET    | `/products/{id}`   | Get a single product by ID           |

## 🧠 Validations
The API includes custom validation rules:

code: Must be exactly 6 integer digits

name: Only letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens allowed

expiration date: Must match DD/MM/YYYY format and be valid (dates prior to the current day are not allowed)

address: We got two store address patterns: 17A-R5 and PAR-123 where:

On "17A-R5" example:
- __17__ is the street number where the product is stored (can go from 1 to 20)
- __A__ is the street side where the product is stored (can be A or B)
- __Hyphen__ split the street info and the stored product position
- __R__ points to the stored product position
- __5__ it's the stored product position (can go from 1 to 6)

and "PAR-123":

- __PAR__ means the product is stored in other stock, and it can go from 1 to ?

Custom exceptions are thrown if validations fail.
